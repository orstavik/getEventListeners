/**
 * Adds a boolean option "scoped" to stopPropagation(), stopImmediatePropagation().
 * When .stopPropagation(true) or .stopImmediatePropagation(true)is called, then
 * the propagation should only be blocked for event listeners in the same DOM context
 * that the event currently propagates.
 *
 * addEventIsStoppedScoped can be applied to:
 *  1. the EventPrototype,
 *  2. the prototype of a specific event type(class), or
 *  3. a specific event object.
 *
 * cancelBubble mostly echoes the native `stopPropagation()`.
 * event.cancelBubble = false    ===     event.stopPropagation(false)
 * let a = event.cancelBubble    ===     let b = event.isStopped(false)
 *
 * However, there are a few things to note:
 *  1. cancelBubble yields the same output if stopPropagation() or stopImmediatePropagation() is called.
 *     This means that it does not accurately reflect the state of propagation.
 *     If you inside an event listener are unsure if stopPropagtion() or stopImmediatePropagtion() has been called on
 *     this event already, for example as a side effect of a complex framework function you have called,
 *     then cancelBubbles gives you no valid output as it will return <true> in either case.
 *  2. stopPropagation(true) and stopImmediatePropagation(true) are excluded from the output of cancelBubble getter.
 *     This is intentional. Event listeners might be still be called on the
 *
 *  Summary. cancelBubble is a bad pattern. With complex event propagation, you should only check the state of
 *  propagation in your current DOM context.
 *  When more advanced event listeners are added that are either {scoped: true} or {unstoppable: true}, that safely
 *  allow web components to generate custom default actions, then a global propagation state simply cease to exists.
